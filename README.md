# threads

This is a project that loads a thread.

In order to set up this project, first install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

and then

```
npm run build:dev 
```

and in order to run it, execute:
```
npm run serve
```

The only path that truly loads is
**/{cfskey}/{cfstoken}**

You have to use a matching **cfskey** and **cfstoken** similarly to the ones used here:
